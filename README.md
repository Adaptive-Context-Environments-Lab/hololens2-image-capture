# Capture images or Stream videos on Hololens/Hololens 2 in Unity Play mode 
A workaround to capture images from hololens while in Unity play mode

## Instructions
* Setup [Hololens 2 Holographic Remoting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/unity/unity-play-mode?tabs=openxr) and make sure you are able to run Play mode with Hololens from Unity
* Add an empty game object to the Unity project
* Create a new Script called "CaptureImage" and add [this](https://github.com/Adaptive-Context-Environments-Lab/hololens2-image-capture/blob/main/CaptureImage.cs) code
* Run with Unity play mode on Hololens 2. You should be able to capture images from Hololens 2 and preview them on a dummy quad in Unity. 
* Use this workaround for Computer vision or other things. Enjoy!

Let me know if you face any issues or have any feedback! Thanks.
